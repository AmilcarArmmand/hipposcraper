## Description

Automating file template creation for Holberton projects, below is the chart of files that it will automate. The program will first ask you for your header file name, skip it by leaving it blank and pressing enter. Then it will ask if you want to include holberton's putchar file. Finally, it will then create a directory with the correct project name with all the project files in it.
